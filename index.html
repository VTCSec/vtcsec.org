  <h1> VTCSEC Summit</h1>
  <p>
    We at Virginia Tech host a Capture the Flag Competition each spring. This year, it will be held on March 28th!
    What makes our competition unique is we have a live network that competitors attack. This hands on experience provides a new twist to the normal connect to a box and hack it, you have to actually find some of your targets first!
    Get more information <a href = "http://vtcsec.org/summit.html">here</a>!
  </p>
  
<h1> Long-running CTF challenge </h1>
To get started, go to <a href= "https://vtcsec.virginiacyberrange.net" target="_blank">here</a> and make an account. You have to be on the VT network to connect, so either go to campus to work or use the VPN. Have fun!
