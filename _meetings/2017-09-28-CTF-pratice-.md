This Thursday, we have will be having a CTF practice meeting instead of a talk. The focus will be Backdoor CTF's challenges from last year. There are many different challenges, suitable for all levels of experience, so don't worry. If you have free time earlier today, go to <a href="https://backdoor.sdslabs.co/" target="_blank">https://backdoor.sdslabs.co/</a>, make an account, and get started in the practice arena.
