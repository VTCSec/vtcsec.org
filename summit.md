## What is it?

The Summit is a CTF competition put on by the Cyber Security Club at Virginia Tech and a networking opportunity for students interested in security.


## When and where is it?

The date for the 2021 event has yet to be determined, though we are aiming for a date around the middle of the spring semester. This year the event will be hosted completely online. Stay tuned for updates.

## What Challenges are there?

VTCSec has designed new challenges for people to solve in person.  We have created challenges related
to real issues in security and have used our experience competing in past CTF's.  We will be hosting challenges
in the following areas:

* Exploitation
* Embedded Hardware
* Networking
* Web applications
* Forensics
* Reversing
* Cryptography
* Operational Security


## What are the team rules?

Teams will have a maximum of 5 members. Teams can register at the event, and do not need to all be from one school. There is a maximum of 2 graduate students per team.


## How can I help? 
Talk to VTCSEC officers in person at a meeting (or by email)! We are always glad to get help.
